The year is 2035. AI technology, under the control of global corporations, 
has permeated every facet of life. Yet beneath this veneer of progress, whispers circulate about 
government cover-ups of alien encounters and hidden advanced technologies. Dr. Emily Carter, a 
rising star in AI ethics, stumbles upon encrypted files that hint at the existence of Project 
Echo, an off-the-books initiative purported to hold universe-altering secrets. Meanwhile, Leo, a 
blue-collar worker disillusioned by the widening gap between social classes, finds an alien artifact 
that reacts to his touch. Their paths cross with Agent Sarah Dawson, a government operative with her 
own dark past, tasked with keeping Project Echo a secret. As they delve deeper, they realize that 
the truth is far more complex and dangerous than they ever imagined.
